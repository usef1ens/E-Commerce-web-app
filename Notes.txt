Basic mechanisms in web applications:

- front end runs in the browser --> on the client's machine
- back end runs in the server --> handles requests, data validation, etc.

- Uniform Resource Locator (URL): the "address of a website" --> enter it into the browser --> sends a request to the server hosting the website
- These interactions between the browser and the server are defined by the HTTP, Hypertext Transfer Protocol.

- Requesting a Page: the server can return the requested webpage by either generating the HTML file and returning it to the client, or generating a data file and sending it to the client to build the webpage (i.e., the frontend builds the webpage)
 --> The latter being the best practice in the industry



Project Notes:

- should I push pipfile and pipfile.lock?
- learn how to make and activate a venv using normal commands, not pipenv
- django-admin is a utility that comes with django
django-admin startproject <name> --> creates a django Project
if you add ".", django creates the project in the current directory


Django Directory file structure:
init file: defines the directory as a package
settings file: to define the settings of the web application
urls file: to store the urls of the web application
asgi and wsgi: for deployment

other files:

manage.py: a wrapper around django-admin utility
now we use it instead of django-admin
--> reason for this is that manage.py takes into account the application's settings

python manage.py <django-admin command>

Apps in a Django Project:

each app in a django project has a certain functionality
got to settings>installedapps
you will find the default apps that django installs for you to manage your project:
django.contrib.admin --> gives the admin interface for managing the data
django.contrib.auth --> used for authenticating users
django.contrib.contenttypes
django.contrib.sessions --> legacy/not used anymore --> a session is a temporary memory
on the server for managing users data, now since we build APIs with django,
we do not use the sessions app --> delete it
django.contrib.messages --> used for displaying one-time notifications for the user
django.contrib.staticfiles --> for serving static files, like images, css files and so on

another django command: startapp <name>
--> makes a new 'app' (a whole project in django is the complete web application structure)

boilerplate file structure of a django 'app':
app_name/
    ├── migrations/         # Stores database changes (empty initially) / for generating database tables
    │   └── __init__.py
    ├── __init__.py         # Tells Python this directory is a package
    ├── admin.py            # Configuration for the Django Admin panel / where we define how the admin interface of this app is going to look like
    ├── apps.py             # App configuration settings / where we configure this app
    ├── models.py           # Database schema (tables and fields) / defining model classes for this app
    ├── tests.py            # Unit tests for this specific app
    └── views.py            # Request/Response logic (your functions)

Note that Django uses the MVT/MVC model architecture in web development:
and an admin file provides the  admin panel (GUI?)

- do not forget to add the new app to the installed apps list in the settings file

Notes on the MVC/MVT architecture:

Model: we use model classes to pull data from the database and present to the user
Views: request handler
more info on views:
HTTP is a request-response protocol, every data exchange involves a request and a response
here is where views is used

view functions:
are defined in the views file; a function that takes a request and returns a response
notes about views and url mapping can be found in the playground views and url files and the main urls file

- Using Templates: (returning HTML content to the client - HTML code generated in the server)
add a templates folder to your specific app (for html code associated with that app)

- we used django debug toolbar, learn more about it later 

- DATA MODELS: how to store and retrieve data

data models used in an e-commerce app:
these are the basic entities that data are stored in and flow from and to, and have different kinds
of relationships
for a product: title, description, price, inventory
for a collection: title
for a cart: ...

organizing data models in apps:
each app in django has a different functionality --> each app has a unique data model

- entities with an independent functionality go into their own app
- entities that are codependent are placed within the same app
- do minimal coupling and high focus

- Creating Model classes: each entity has a class defined in the models file of the app it belongs to

NOTE: LEARN DATA MODELLING AND RELATIONAL DATABASES!!!
